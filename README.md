How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?


Writing code in such a way enables one to spend more time on bigger functions of the code and debugging. If the code is messy or hard to read, navigating it will be troublesome and cause wasted time down the road. 
Having worked on Project 1 and setting up the database and having a seperate code for testing made it neater and easier to follow when I had trouble. I can use this CRUD file again if I needed another application used for similiar search functions using a csv file or similiar document. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Looking at each fix me in the code allowed me to set up opportunities for myself to complete smaller steps to chip away at the bigger picture. This course was rewarding in that I could run the application and see my work in real time appear and not just a simple print screen either. I would do more reading on dash applications specifically callback functions to ensure proper rendering of all requirements. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists use their knowledge to problem solve given tasks for a user. If that person is well versed in a particular language they can use that skill set to make a database for storing files much like in this course. The answer might not be found right away but it is more important to find new ways of thinking to troubleshoot.
